## Make your repositories sing

Tonalhub fetches the commit activity for the past year to turn it into music. Each week will play a sound for every day that had a commit in it. 

I've taken Tonalhub temporarily offline, but feel free to launch it yourself !

### Rate limits
Tonalhub uses Github's API to fetch the commit activity. If you get a rate exceeded error, please try again in a few minutes.
